 This App is a eCommerce and blog created to promote and share the creations of
the Taiwanese artist Ponpon.
  
 The App design was created by me, using Figma to create the design system and using 
SCSS to apply it. You can visit the design system and case study in the following link:

[Case study](https://uxfol.io/project/034b93cd/Une-Felt-Case-Study) 

 The eCommerce part was created using ReactJs and Redux in the frontend and uses Wordpress
and Woocommerce in the backend. For the payments Stripe payment was implemented.

 The blog part, uses Wordpress as well, in a way of giving easy access to all the advantages 
that the environment provides out of the box.
